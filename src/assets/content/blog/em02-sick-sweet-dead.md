setting: siantar, sunday, \~AM / churches and naves / a choir performed by moving staircases  / insufficient upper body strength v. an overwhelming need to prove oneself / old flame / reminiscing kisses behind an old piano / torn flesh on forearm / not a gush, but a trickle of blood / precise and careful movements / two sets of ladders that lead to very similar, but different, places / a flawed youth with a pulpit / an orca sticker

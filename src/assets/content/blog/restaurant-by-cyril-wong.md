1\.  
What happens when words dissolve in water, in wine? Do they take on the colour of grapes, plum-and-lilac like glimmering petals in summer? Do they take on the shape of their vessel, a vase—a false containment?

2\.  
Would an object remember its owners? Would places remember their strangers? Or is remembrance an echo; forgotten once the thought slips away from my mind? Remind me, then. Remind me of the things I've once lost. Remind me forever.

3\.  
The bringing of food is the gentlest of kindness. The sharing of food, is one of the oldest, kindest, and most selfless form of love.

> And what was said? Or was there  
> just a long silence amplified by banal

> current profession, boyfriend?  
> What was missing: deeper  
> interest; a willingness to enjoy  
> the company; or just a question  
> about the lessons of a solitary life  
> that could turn it all around,  
> leading to friendship, even tenderness.  
> So what’s lost that I fail to recall;  
> much less a tragedy than I need it  
> to be? What remains: a gap in the mind,  
> the shattered echo of a possibility;  
> less than a feeling now, then not even that.

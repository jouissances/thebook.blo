* setting: tambun, tuesday morning \~6-8AM
* woke up late for school, a hurried affair involving textbooks and a PE uniform
* the driver's left
* mom had to call in help — the whole village was involved
* a handsome boy was utterly unhappy and spread dissent
* sampans and hyenas lunging and dirty rivers
* making up
* attending class
* the teacher claimed to be siddharta mukherjee — i somehow had a copy of his lesser-known book on my desk
* i've never seen his face — but i believed him (in hindsight, this was a horrible, horrible mistake)
* the university amphitheater
